# Supply_Chain_Data_Analysis_Power_BI_Dashboard

This data set appears that the report will focus on an analysis of a supply chain dataset from the company DataCo Global. The dataset contains both structured data, which is contained in a CSV file called DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv, and unstructured data in the form of a tokenized access log file called tokenized_access_logs.csv. The dataset covers areas of important activities such as provisioning, production, sales, and commercial distribution and allows for the use of machine learning algorithms and R software.

The report will focus on three types of products: clothing, sports, and electronic supplies. Additionally, there is a separate file called DescriptionDataCoSupplyChain.csv, which contains a description of each variable in the DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv file. The variables include days for shipping, benefit per order, sales per customer, delivery status, late delivery risk, customer information such as city, country, email, name, and password, department information, latitude and longitude, market, order information such as city, country, date, and status, product information such as category, description, image, name, price, and status, and shipping information such as date and mode.

Overall, the report will likely analyze the supply chain data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can inform decision-making and improve supply chain performance. The combination of structured and unstructured data will allow for a more comprehensive analysis and the correlation of data to generate new knowledge. The report may also explore how machine learning algorithms and R software can be used to analyze the data and make predictions about future supply chain performance.
